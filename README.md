# INFO
After careful considiration, I have taken down the original code from this repo as it appeared to break Toybox's TOS

Due to this, I have transformed this readme into a tutorial.

# Steps:
1. Make an account on https://make.toys/toys
2. Go to the page of the stl file you want.
3. Check if there is an edit button below the print. If yes, this will work. If not, this will not work.
4. Open your browser's devtools and switch to the network tab. Begin recording.
5. Click edit while having your devtools open.
6. You should see a request for an stl file.
7. Copy this link and download it. (wget, curl, etc...)
8. Done!
